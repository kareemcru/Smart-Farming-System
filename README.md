# Summary
The *overall* project of making this **Smart Farm System** began at 0830 on 11-May-2021 and is designed to aid farmers in *not only* the **health** of their crops, 
but the **security** and **sanctity** of their crops as well. **Stephanie Perea and Kareem Crum** worked *tirelessly* to implement the components in such a fashion that would
bring their vision for **hemp** farmers to *fruition. Stephanie handled the bulk of the **fabricating** for this project as well as the **power point presentation** and **component 
research**. Kareem handled the bulk of the **coding** for this project as well as the **Adafruit.IO dashboard** and **Hackster.io**. Stephanie and Kareem worked *together* to keep a 
good work pace and collaborated on some of the overall project's *asthetics*. The completion of the project was on 21-MAY-2021 and was the same day as the overall project presentation.

The Smart Farming System houses a weather station and a plant monitoring system.​ The weather station is comprised of 2 components and a cloud- based website. ​The first component is the
BME280 which is a temperature, humidity and pressure sensor.​ The second component is a monochrome I2C OLED Display unit with a 128 x 64 resolution dot matrix panel.​ The weather data can
be accessed from anywhere in the world via Adafruit.io which provides real-time data on the status of the crop’s environment. The plant monitoring system comprises of two components, a 
soil sensor and the Grove Dust sensor. Both of these components are rather simple in both implantation and function; however, they both play critical roles in alleviating burden from farmers.
The soil sensor is implanted directly into the ground via stake, and gathers the moisture readings from the surrounding region in order to aid the farmer in determining plant health. 
The dust sensor sits inside of our fabricated box in order to gather pollen readings in a valiant attempt to aid the farmer in determining the overall atmospheric conditions for the 
surrounding region. Both of these two systems can be monitored in a user friendly interface known as Adafruit.IO dashboard, in which, the data has already been collected, converted, 
and crafted to be aesthetically pleasing.

The Smart Farming System also houses a security system and pest deterring system. The components necessary for these functions are the Ultrasonic Sensor, the Stepper motor and it's driver board.
The Stepper motor's only function is to turn the Ultrasonic sensor 180 degrees and back to its starting position. The main magic comes from the Ultrasonic sensor! This advanced sensor 
coupled with our innovative code and thinking, can pulse out frequencies that will naturally deter pests from the given region (13 feet). Furthermore, the Ultrasonic sensor also has the
capability to simultaneously count the amount of time between each given pulse and its return in order to determine not only distance, but INTRUDERS as well! This component will notify the
farmer about any changes in location pulsing via SMS text messaging through Zapier.com as well as by changing the colors on the Adafruit.IO dashboard.

Finally, the Smart Farming System has two vital functions! The second to last is GPS and fall detection systems. The GPS functions are utilized in determining the location of the unit but
this function is catered more towards large farm field owners. Furthermore, the GPS constantly populates a street map of real time coordinates on the Adafruit.IO dashboard. 
The fall detection system utilizes the MPU 6050 component in order to constantly give back data as to the orientation of the box. This data is expected to consistently give back the 
same date (primarily because the box stays in place). However, if the MPU reads a change in data on any of the axis planes (Z, X, Y), it will notify the farmer via SMS text message
as well as changing the colors on the Adafruit.IO dashboard.

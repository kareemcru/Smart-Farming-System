# Summary
The *overall* project of making this **Smart Farm System** began at 0830 on 11-May-2021 and is designed to aide farmers in *not only* the **health** of their crops, 
but the **security** and **sanctity** of their crops as well. **Stephanie Perea and Kareem Crum** worked *tirelessly* to implement the components in such a fashion that would
bring their vision for **hemp** farmers to *fruition. Stephanie handled the bulk of the **fabrication** for this project as well as the **power point presentation** and **component research**. Kareem handled the bulk of the **coding** for this project as well as the **Adafruit.IO dashboard**g and the **Github Project Repository**. Both Kareem and Stephanie contributed to **Hackster.io** and worked as a *team* smoothly and keeping a good working pace.  Collaborated on the overall project's *asthetics*. The project's completion date is 21-MAY-2021 with the conclusion ending with an online presentation with industry leaders.

The Smart Farming System houses a weather station and a plant monitoring system.​ The weather station is comprised of 2 components and a cloud- based website. ​The first component is the BME280 which is a temperature, humidity and pressure sensor.​ The second component is a monochrome I2C OLED Display unit with a 128 x 64 resolution dot matrix panel.​ The weather data can be accessed from anywhere in the world via Adafruit.io which provides real-time data on a crop’s environment and soil status. The plant monitoring system comprises of two components, a soil sensor and the Grove Particulate/Dust sensor. Both of these components are rather simple in both implementation and function; as well as, in the critical rolls they play in alleviating multiple burden off a farmers shoulders.
The soil sensor is implanted directly into the ground via stake, and gathers the moisture readings from the surrounding region in order to aid the farmer in detecting plant stress which affects a farmer's yield. 
The particulate/dust sensor sits within the wooden enclosure behind a living hinge which allows for ample air circultion for optimal pollen readings, all awhile protecting the component from the elements. The precision of these two components serve to aid the farmer in determining the overall environmental conditionsm be it in the soil or in the atmospheric surroundings of the region. Both components monitoring feeds are utilized through a user friendly, cloud computing interface known as Adafruit.IO dashboard which was crafted to be aesthetically pleasing and easy to understand.

The Smart Farming System also houses a security system and pest deterring system. One component fulfills the function of both systems at the same time. It is able to do so with the use of an Ultrasonic Sensor and a Stepper motor connected to an Argon microcontroller.
The Stepper motor serves as the mechanism provideing afull sweep of the full area the ultrasonic sensor is protecting. The step motor makes 180 degree turns continuously every 5 seconds. The magic happens when the Ultrasonic sensor is engaged! This advanced sensor, coupled with our innovative code and logic, sends out 8 pulses each 40 kH in frequency, to naturally deter pests within a half circle radius, with a 36-foot reach. Furthermore, the Ultrasonic sensor also has the capability to simultaneously count the amount of time between each, 8-pulse segment and a return pusle(s). The number of seconds assists in determinating the approximate location of an INTRUDER as well! This component will notify the farmer about any changes in location pulsing via an SMS text message through Zapier.com; as well as by changing the colors on the Adafruit.IO dashboard from purple to red.

We will now move on to vital functions that help the farmer know the status of the system! Second to last is the GPS and fall detection systems. The GPS functions are utilized in determining the location of the unit but this function is catered more towards large farm field owners. Furthermore, the GPS constantly populates a street map of real time coordinates on the Adafruit.IO dashboard. 
The fall detection system utilizes the MPU 6050 component in order to constantly give back data as to the orientation of the box. This data is expected to consistently give back the same date (primarily because the box stays in place). However, if the MPU reads a change in data on any of the axis planes (Z, X, Y), it will notify the farmer via SMS text message as well as changing the colors on the Adafruit.IO dashboard.

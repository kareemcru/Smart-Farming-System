# Summary
The *overall* project of making this **Smart Farm System** began at 0830 on 11-May-2021 and is designed to aid farmers in *not only* the **health** of their crops, 
but the **security** and **sanctity** of their crops as well. **Stephanie Perea and Kareem Crum** worked *tirelessly* to implement the components in such a fashion that would
bring their vision for **hemp** farmers to *fruition. Stephanie handled the bulk of the **fabricating** for this project as well as the **power point presentation** and **component 
research**. Kareem handled the bulk of the **coding** for this project as well as the **Adafruit.IO dashboard** and **Hackster.io**. Stephanie and Kareem worked *together* to keep a 
good work pace and collaborated on some of the overall project's *asthetics*. The completion of the project was on 21-MAY-2021 and was the same day as the overall project presentation.
